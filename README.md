# Document OCR Frontend 

The contents of this repoistory conatain the frontend elements of the Document OCR Tool. The tool 
made primarily for math/physics/engineering work. See more in the other repository.

**NOTE**: This was primarily made through the use of Figma Templates and Figma's proprietary AI Tooling.
I do _not_ really know Javascript, Typescript, React and general npm and Node Js projects.

See [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for more details.

See related backend project: [Document-OCR-Backend](https://github.com/john-samis/Document-OCR-Backend)
